        <p>Welcome to the 3D Exhibition of Quindio, Colombia. This exhibition features my experiences during my visit to Colombia with the University of Texas. I saw a lot of coffee farms and beautiful nature, especially birds. Join me in exploring the highlights of this beautiful region.</p>

            <p>Yes, you read that right. During my trip, I and 21 other passengers rode in this Willy Jeep across the beautiful Colombian landscape. Willys are a common sight and symbolize the resilience and spirit of the Quindio region.</p>

            <h2>Specialty Coffee Farm</h2>
            <p>In contrast to other coffee farmers, he has specialized in specialty coffee and creating an experience for tourists. It was the first time I saw how coffee was harvested, processed, and tasted it. It was a really pleasant experience. At the finca, he told us that he started out working in the cocaine business. Through work in the business, he transitioned to having his own specialty coffee farm. The question arises: is it okay to indulge in the drug business in his situation? He was very poor, and as an uneducated worker, he had no future. Engaging in the business posed violence to people, his country, and himself. How much are we willing to sacrifice to make it? People living in poverty have no future, and sometimes the choices are stark.</p>

            <p>Music is a universal language that connects people and cultures. Even though I often struggled to understand the colombian accent, the sound of salsa always got me on the dance floor. I encourage everyone to try salsa dancing—it’s a fantastic way to connect with others!</p>
